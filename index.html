                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Food Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">The Online Ordering System can be defined as a simple and convenient way for customers to purchase food online, without having to go to the restaurant.
                  This system is enabled by the internet – it is the internet that connects the restaurant or the food company on one hand, and the customer on other hand.
                   Therefore, as per this system, the customer visits the restaurant’s app or website, 
                   browses through the various food items, combos and cuisines available there and goes ahead and selects and purchases the items he or she needs.</p>
